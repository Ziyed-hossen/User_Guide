Benchmarking Scorecard
======================

Purpose
-------

Benchmark your hotel’s digital marketing performance to identify gaps using KPIs other than just ROAS. The scorecard is calculated once a month to see how your hotel compares to three benchmarks.

Calculations & Exclusions
-------------------------

- **Index Score** = (Hotel's Metric Value / Average Metric Value) × 100
- **Exclusions**: Certain data points are excluded from calculations if the standard deviation exceeds 3 or if traffic numbers are less than 100.

The 3 Benchmarks
----------------

1. **Weighted Historical Average**: Compare current data with previous months of prior years.
2. **Portfolio**: Compare the hotel’s data to that of the enterprise/portfolio for the same month/year.
3. **Chain Scale**: Compare the hotel’s data to the assigned chain scale for the same month/year.

Scoring Logic
-------------

- Full-Service hotels weigh social media KPIs more heavily than Select Service hotels.
- Select Service hotels are weighted less heavily for social media KPIs.
